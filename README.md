CSSE3010-QEMU-Examples
======================

These are examples and demos desinged to run on the QEMU 'Netduino Plus 2' board model that I am working on. The QEMU branch can be found at: https://github.com/alistair23/qemu/tree/netduinoplus2.dev These examples are written specifically to target the University of Queensland course CSSE3010.

The examples folder includes examples of standard code that will run on QEMU. The src folder includes all of the source code that is required to compile the examples. These are based off the CSSE3010 repo by Matthew D'Souza.

'project1.patch' shows the changes that are required to a standard CSSE3010 student's project to ensure it will run on QEMU.

The demo folder has demos that have been specifically written to show off how QEMU can aid the students and teachers of the CSSE3010 course.
